## <ins>Description</ins>

Comic Con is a well known convention with tons of venders who sell merch for every type of pop culture you can think of. However tickets sell out quickly, why not avoid the crowds and shop for rare collector's items from the comfort of your couch? 


We created an ecommerce application that allows you create listing for your figurines, cards, games, etc., or you can purchase items that other people are listing for sell.
